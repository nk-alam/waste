# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing due to a dependency conflict with `react-leaflet@5.0.0`, which requires React 19, but the project uses React 18.3.1.

## Error Details
```
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^19.0.0" from react-leaflet@5.0.0
npm error Found: react@18.3.1
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Downgraded react-leaflet to compatible version
- Changed `react-leaflet` from `^5.0.0` to `^4.2.1`
- Version 4.2.1 is compatible with React 18.x

### 2. Added .npmrc configuration
- Created `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- This helps handle peer dependency warnings during deployment
- Added `fund=false` and `audit=false` to reduce build output noise

### 3. Regenerated package-lock.json
- Removed old package-lock.json
- Ran `npm install` to generate new lock file with correct dependencies

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Updated react-leaflet version
2. `.npmrc` - New file created
3. `package-lock.json` - Regenerated with new dependencies

## Verification
- ✅ Build test passed: `npm run build` successful
- ✅ Dependency tree valid: `react-leaflet@4.2.1` installed
- ✅ No breaking changes in existing code (API compatibility maintained)

This fix ensures the project will deploy successfully on Vercel with all features intact.
